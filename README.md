# HapticStylus
Researching, designing, and fabricating a handheld haptic device for VR/AR surgical training simulations. The device will provide cutaneous/ tactile feedback to the user when interacting with virtual objects. 

The cutaneous/tactile feedback is generated by driving two rockers against the user's thumb and index finger resulting in skin stretch. The two rockers are directly driven via two high precision micro servos motors. 

The haptic stylus is integrated with virtual simulations in order to determine the devices effectiveness for creating an illusion of directional force-feedback to the user.

The control system was developed in micropython on a Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect microcrontroller and the virtual simulation was developed in C# on Unity.
