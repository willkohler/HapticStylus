*Getting Started/Helpful Tips*

When connecting the microcontroller to Thonny IDE go to the run tab and click the project interperter. From here you want to change 
the interpeter to MicroPython (RP2040). Then you want to go to the port and select the USB serial port that your device is connected to. 
If you need help figuring out which port your device is on go the the Device Manager on your computer and you will find it there.

When setting up the UDP connection you need the IP address of the microcontroller and the computer which Unity is running on. 
The IP address of the computer goes in the main.py file on the microcontroller and the IP address of the microcontroller goes into the 
Hand.cs file inside of Unity.
